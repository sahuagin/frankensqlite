# Profile-First Optimization Cards and One-Lever Proof Packs

**Bead:** `bd-db300.7.5.4` (G5.4)
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Status:** Operational contract
**Depends on:** G5.3 (evidence ownership, CLOSED), A4.1 (metric dictionary, CLOSED)

---

## Purpose

No code-changing performance bead may begin implementation without a measured
hotspot, an EV-scored recommendation card, and a behavior-preserving proof
plan. This contract makes that discipline enforceable by defining the card
schema, the score gate, the proof-pack contents, and the gap-conversion rules
that turn missing evidence into tracked work.

---

## 1. Optimization Recommendation Card Schema

Every code-changing performance bead must carry a recommendation card before
implementation begins. The card is a structured record, not prose.

## 2. Required Fields and Gate Rules

### 2.1 Mandatory Fields (No Exceptions)

| Field | Gate Rule |
|-------|----------|
| `bead_id` | Must be a valid bead ID |
| `hotspot_artifact` | Must point to an existing profile artifact |
| `hotspot_rank` | Must be 1–5 (top-5 by the named metric) |
| `hotspot_rank_metric` | Must be in the metric dictionary (A4.1) |
| `baseline_comparator` | Must name the reference (sqlite3, previous commit) |
| `profile_command` | Must be a runnable command |
| `ev_score` | Must be ≥ 2.0 unless `override_reason` is non-null |
| `score_formula` | Must name the factors |
| `one_lever_scope` | Must describe exactly one change |
| `one_lever_files` | Must list the files that will change |
| `proof_block.oracle` | Must name the correctness oracle |
| `proof_block.proof_rerun` | Must be a runnable command |
| `rollback_recipe` | Must describe how to undo |

### 2.2 Score Gate

```
IF ev_score < 2.0 AND override_reason IS NULL:
  → REJECT: bead cannot proceed to implementation
  → Create a bead: "Profile deeper for {bead_id} — EV too low"

IF ev_score < 2.0 AND override_reason IS NOT NULL:
  → ACCEPT with audit trail
  → Valid override reasons:
    - "correctness_blocker" (fixing a bug, not optimizing)
    - "blocking_benchmark_repair" (bd-zna34 class)
    - "architectural_prerequisite" (must land before higher-EV work)
  → Any other reason requires human approval
```

### 2.3 Hotspot Rank Gate

```
IF hotspot_rank > 5:
  → REJECT: lever is not in the top-5 hotspots
  → Valid exception: hotspot_rank_scope = "top_5_by_tail" (p99 focused)
    OR hotspot_rank_scope = "top_5_by_allocations"
  → The rank must be in the top-5 of SOME dominant metric, not just
    a plausible-sounding thing to improve
```

### 2.4 One-Lever Attribution Gate

```
IF one_lever_files touches more than 3 crates:
  → WARNING: broad change surface — verify single-lever attribution
  → Card must explain why multiple crates are needed for ONE lever

IF one_lever_scope contains "and" or lists multiple independent changes:
  → REJECT: split into separate beads with separate cards
  → Each lever gets its own card, baseline, proof, and attribution
```

---

## 3. One-Lever Proof Pack

Each optimization card references a proof pack. The proof pack is the evidence
bundle that proves the lever works without breaking correctness.

```
artifacts/{bead_id}/proof_pack/
├── baseline_profile.jsonl     ← Hot-path profile BEFORE the change
├── after_profile.jsonl        ← Hot-path profile AFTER the change
├── delta_summary.json         ← Machine-diff of baseline vs after
├── correctness_result.json    ← Oracle comparison result (pass/fail)
├── invariant_check.json       ← Specific invariants checked
├── rerun.sh                   ← Reproduce both profiles
└── rollback_test.json         ← Proof that rollback recipe works
```

### 3.1 `delta_summary.json`

```json
{
  "bead_id": "bd-db300.4.3.1",
  "lever": "program_cache_reuse",
  "baseline_commit": "abc123",
  "after_commit": "def456",
  "metric_deltas": [
    {"metric": "c1_disjoint_throughput", "baseline": 48000, "after": 67200, "delta_pct": 40.0, "direction": "improvement"},
    {"metric": "c1_disjoint_p99_ns", "baseline": 250000, "after": 200000, "delta_pct": -20.0, "direction": "improvement"},
    {"metric": "c4_mixed_throughput", "baseline": 95000, "after": 96000, "delta_pct": 1.0, "direction": "neutral"}
  ],
  "attribution_confidence": "high",
  "attribution_method": "single_commit_delta",
  "confounders_checked": ["no other commits between baseline and after", "same hardware", "same seed"]
}
```

### 3.2 `rollback_test.json`

```json
{
  "rollback_method": "pragma_disable",
  "rollback_command": "PRAGMA fsqlite.program_cache = off",
  "post_rollback_throughput": 48500,
  "post_rollback_matches_baseline": true,
  "rollback_latency_ms": 0
}
```

### 3.3 Benchmark Catastrophe Recovery Packs

Some benchmark-recovery slices are measurement-only work in `fsqlite-e2e`
rather than direct code changes in the engine. Those slices still need a typed
proof artifact instead of ad hoc stderr lines.

Current operational example: `bd-wwqen` IN-subquery catastrophe recovery.

- 10k residual probe:
  `manual_perf_probe.read_guard_shapes.in_subquery`
  Contract: pass if `p50 < 500us` and `p95 < 800us`
  Legacy anchor: `p50=3760us p95=4429us throughput=266 ops/sec`
- 100k catastrophe probe:
  `manual_hot_path_profile.in_subquery_100k`
  Contract: pass if `wall < 200ms`
  Hard fail if `wall > 5s`
  Legacy anchor: `~20s wall time`

The canonical artifact for these slices is:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "fsqlite-e2e.benchmark_recovery_report.v1",
  "bead_id": "bd-wwqen",
  "slice_id": "in_subquery_catastrophe_recovery",
  "thresholds": [
    {
      "probe_id": "in_subquery_10k_latency",
      "target_summary": "PASS if p50 < 500us and p95 < 800us"
    },
    {
      "probe_id": "in_subquery_100k_wall_time",
      "target_summary": "PASS if wall < 200ms; HARD FAIL if wall > 5s"
    }
  ]
}
```

Packaging rule:

- keep the legacy human-readable log lines because bead history may cite them
- also emit the structured recovery report JSON
- emit a markdown summary derived from the same typed report so pass/fail
  decisions are reproducible and reviewable without reinterpreting the raw logs

---

## 4. Controller/Policy-Bearing Optimization Cards

When the lever involves adaptive behavior (E4 guardrail thresholds, DRO
parameters, GC escalation tiers), additional fields are mandatory:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `expected_loss_model` | How expected loss is computed for the policy decision |
| `calibration_trigger` | What triggers recalibration (regime shift, drift detection) |
| `budgeted_mode` | Resource budget and what it protects |
| `on_exhaustion_behavior` | What happens when the budget is consumed |
| `fallback_trigger` | Concrete condition that reverts to safe/conservative mode |
| `shadow_lineage` | Run ID of the conservative baseline for comparison |

These fields map to the G5.3 evidence-ownership registry's `policy_id`,
`decision_id`, `budget_id`, and `shadow_lineage` columns.

---

## 5. Gap-Conversion Rules

### G1: Missing Baseline Profile → Block Implementation

```
IF hotspot_artifact does not exist or is stale (> 7 days old):
  → Implementation BLOCKED
  → Create bead: "Capture baseline profile for {bead_id}"
  → Priority: same as the implementation bead
```

### G2: Missing Proof Pack → Block Scorecard Claim

```
IF proof_pack directory is empty or correctness_result.json missing:
  → The lever's delta CANNOT appear on the scorecard
  → Create bead: "Complete proof pack for {bead_id}"
```

### G3: Multi-Lever Bundle → Split

```
IF one_lever_scope describes more than one independent change:
  → Split into N beads, each with its own card
  → The parent bead becomes an epic that coordinates them
  → Each child bead must independently pass the EV gate
```

### G4: Missing Rollback Recipe → Block Merge

```
IF rollback_recipe is null or empty:
  → The change CANNOT be merged to main
  → Every optimization must be reversible without data loss
```

---

## 6. Validation Entrypoint

```bash
scripts/verify_g5_4_profile_contract.sh
```

This script:
1. Enumerates all code-changing performance beads in the program (from the
   beads database, filtered by label `perf` or `db300-program`).
2. For each bead, checks:
   - Optimization card exists (JSON file in `artifacts/{bead_id}/`).
   - All mandatory fields are present and non-null.
   - `ev_score >= 2.0` OR `override_reason` is valid.
   - `hotspot_rank <= 5`.
   - `one_lever_files` lists ≤ 3 crates (or has justification).
   - `proof_block.proof_rerun` is a syntactically valid command.
   - `rollback_recipe` is non-empty.
3. Reports:
   - Beads with complete cards (ready for implementation).
   - Beads with incomplete cards (missing fields listed).
   - Beads with no card at all (gap → G1 rule).
4. Emits `artifacts/g5_4_profile_contract_report.json`.
5. Exits 0 if all Quick-mandatory beads have complete cards, 1 otherwise.

---

## 7. Structured Log Schema

When an optimization card is evaluated (at implementation start, proof
verification, or scorecard compilation):

```rust
tracing::info!(
    target: "fsqlite::optimize::card",
    trace_id = %trace_id,
    scenario_id = %scenario_id,
    bead_id = %bead_id,
    baseline_comparator = %baseline,
    hotspot_artifact = %hotspot_path,
    ev_score = ev,
    relevance_score = relevance,
    priority_tier = %tier,
    score_formula = %formula,
    hotspot_rank = rank,
    hotspot_rank_metric = %metric,
    one_lever_scope = %scope,
    target_metric = %target,
    fallback_trigger = fallback.as_deref().unwrap_or("none"),
    proof_artifact = %proof_path,
    rollback_recipe = %rollback,
    card_status = %status,  // "complete", "incomplete", "blocked", "override"
);
```

- **EV:** 3.2 (0.42 × 0.80 × 0.95)
- **Lever:** LRU program cache keyed by (sql_hash, schema_epoch)
- **Proof:** Row-level oracle against rusqlite; schema_epoch invalidation test
- **Rollback:** `PRAGMA fsqlite.program_cache = off`

### 8.2 bd-db300.4.4.1 (Copy-Kernel Elimination)

- **Hotspot:** Cell assembly + payload copy = 18% of c1 wall time (rank 3 by time)
- **EV:** 2.1 (0.18 × 0.65 × 0.80 × correction for already-optimized paths)
- **Lever:** Zero-copy cell reference for in-cache pages

- **Rollback:** Feature flag `FSQLITE_COPY_KERNEL_V2=off`

### 8.3 bd-3t52f (DRO Abort Policy)

- **Hotspot:** Abort cascades under skew = p99 tail contributor (rank 2 by tail)
- **EV:** 2.8 (measured via adversarial schedule bd-1uguv)
- **Lever:** DRO loss matrix replacing static threshold
- **Proof:** SSI serializable oracle; adversarial schedule p99 non-regression

## 9. Consequences for Downstream

| Downstream | What It Gets |
|------------|-------------|
| **D1.b, D1.c** (parallel WAL) | Card schema and proof-pack requirements for WAL lever |
| **E2.2.c** (fused entry) | Card schema for fused prepared-DML entry lever |
| **E3.3.a** (metadata publication) | Card schema for immutable publication lever |
| **G5.5** (regime atlas) | EV scores and hotspot ranks for regime classification |
| **G5.6** (shadow oracle) | Shadow lineage fields in controller-bearing cards |
| **G4** (final scorecard) | Proof-pack delta_summary.json as scorecard cell evidence |
