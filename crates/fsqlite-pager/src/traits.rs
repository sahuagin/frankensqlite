//! Storage trait hierarchy for MVCC pager and checkpoint operations.

//! This module defines the sealed, internal-only traits that encode

//! # Sealed Trait Discipline (§9)

//! Internal traits use `mod sealed { pub trait Sealed {} }` so that

//! - **Open (user-implementable):** `Vfs`, `VfsFile` (in `fsqlite-vfs`)
