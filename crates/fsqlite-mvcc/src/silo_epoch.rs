//! Silo-style epoch group commit primitive (IMPL-16 / AG-5A).
//!
//! Implements the epoch-based group commit scheme from Silo (Tu et al.,
//! OSDI 2013). Instead of fsyncing the WAL per transaction, transactions
//! submit a *commit waiter* into a time-bucketed epoch; a background
//! advancer thread closes the current epoch every `epoch_duration_us`
//! microseconds, performs a single WAL flush for the entire bucket, and
//! then wakes every waiter that was submitted into the closed epoch.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! MT-bench on current main shows fsqlite degrading 4->8 threads
//! (43k -> 30k writes/sec) because every transaction pays the per-txn WAL
//! flush cost. Group-committing within a ~40µs epoch window amortizes that
//! fsync across the bucket: throughput scales with batch size, and the
//! bounded epoch window caps tail latency.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This is an MVP scaffold: the primitive is self-contained and tested,
//! but it is **not yet wired** into the real commit paths. A follow-up
//! will invoke [`EpochGroupCommit::submit`] from the commit routine and
//! replace the dummy flush callback with the real WAL fsync.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! - [`EpochGroupCommit::new`] spawns a background advancer task.
//! - [`EpochGroupCommit::submit`] returns a [`CommitWaiter`] that becomes
//!   ready exactly when the epoch it was submitted into is closed and
//!   flushed.
//! - [`EpochGroupCommit::advance_epoch`] is exposed for tests and for
//!   forcing an early flush from a synchronous context (e.g. an explicit
//!   COMMIT that does not want to pay the epoch latency).
//! - [`EpochGroupCommit::wait_for_commit`] blocks on a `Condvar` until the
//!   waiter's `ready` flag is set by the advancer.
//!
//! # Guarantees
//!
//! - Every submitted waiter is eventually resolved (advancer task runs
//!   forever until [`EpochGroupCommit`] is dropped).
//! - A waiter submitted at epoch `E` is resolved only after the flush
//!   callback for epoch `E` returns, so on wakeup the caller can assume
//!   its WAL frames are durable.
//! - Dropping an `EpochGroupCommit` signals the advancer to exit, drains
//!   any outstanding waiters (marking them ready so no one blocks
//!   forever), and joins the task.
