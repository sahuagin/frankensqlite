//! Integration tests for the SSI e-process gate wired into the real
//! commit path. These tests cover the "does it actually skip?" behaviour
//! (separate from the API-level contract covered in
//! `ssi_e_process_gate.rs`).
//!
//! Safety contract under test:
//!
//! 1. Under `write_merge = SAFE`, the gate is never consulted and the
//!    commit path runs full SSI validation on every concurrent commit.
//! 2. Under `write_merge = LAB_UNSAFE`, the gate eventually opens on a
//!    pivot-free workload and grants at least some skips. The final DB
//!    state matches a SAFE-mode run of the same workload byte-for-byte.
//! 3. An adversarial workload that injects a true page-level write-write
//!    conflict must NOT cross the e-process threshold; FCW (first-
//!    committer-wins) catches the conflict regardless of SSI skip.
