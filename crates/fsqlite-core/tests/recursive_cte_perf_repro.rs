//! Performance regression repro for recursive CTEs.
//!
//! Bench observation: `WITH RECURSIVE s(x) AS (SELECT 1 UNION ALL
//! SELECT x+1 FROM s WHERE x<N) SELECT SUM(x) FROM s` showed O(n^2)
//! behaviour, with n=1000 taking ~24 ms vs C SQLite's 142 us.
//!
//! This test measures total query time at several sizes and asserts
//! the scaling is sub-quadratic.
